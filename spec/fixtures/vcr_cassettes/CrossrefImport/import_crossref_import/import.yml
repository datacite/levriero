        performance engineering traditionally assumes measuring on bare-metal environments
        to control for as many confounding factors as possible. Unfortunately, some
        researchers and practitioners might not have access, knowledge, or funds to
        operate dedicated performance testing hardware, making public clouds an attractive
        alternative. However, cloud environments are inherently unpredictable and
        variable with respect to their performance. In this study, we explore the
        effects of cloud environments on the variability of performance testing outcomes,
        and to what extent regressions can still be reliably detected. We focus on
        software microbenchmarks as an example of performance tests, and execute extensive
        experiments on three different cloud services (AWS, GCE, and Azure) and for
        different types of instances. We also compare the results to a hosted bare-metal
        offering from IBM Bluemix. In total, we gathered more than 5 million unique
        microbenchmarking data points from benchmarks written in Java and Go. We find
        that the variability of results differs substantially between benchmarks and
        instance types (from 0.03% to &gt; 100% relative standard deviation). We also
        observe that testing using Wilcoxon rank-sum generally leads to unsatisfying
        results for detecting regressions due to a very high number of false positives
        in all tested configurations. However, simply testing for a difference in
        medians can be employed with good success to detect even small differences.
        In some cases, a difference as low as a 1% shift in median execution time
        can be found with a low false positive rate given a large sample size of 20
        instances.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.7287\/peerj.preprints.3507","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2018,1,4]],"date-time":"2018-01-04T16:48:01Z","timestamp":1515084481000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Performance

        off the island of Nosy Be. Dedicated whale shark tourism has been developing
        in the area since 2011. During our first dedicated survey, from September-December
        2016, we photo-identified 85 individual whale sharks, ranging from 3.5\u20138
        m in total length (all juveniles). None had been previously identified from
        other known whale shark aggregations. We tagged eight sharks with tethered
        SPOT5 tags in October 2016, with tracking durations of 9\u2013199 days. Kernel
        density plots showed that the main activity hotspot for tagged sharks was
        around the Nosy Be area. Three individuals were resighted back at Nosy Be
        in late 2017, after having lost their tags. A secondary hotspot was identified
        off Pointe d\u2019Analalava, 180 km southeast of Nosy Be. Five sharks swam
        off the shelf into the northeastern Mozambique Channel, between Madagascar
        and Mayotte, and one of these continued to near the Comoros islands. Two sharks
        swam to southern Madagascar, with minimum track distances of 3414 km and 4275
        km. The species is presently unprotected in Madagascar, although a small proportion
        of the high-use area we identified in this study is encompassed within two
        marine protected areas adjacent to Nosy Be. Whale sharks are globally endangered,

        Minute to medium-sized (FL less than 30 cm) tridactyl dinosaur tracks are
        the most abundant in the Late Jurassic tracksites of Highway A16 (Reuchenette
        Formation, Kimmeridgian) in the Jura Mountains (NW Switzerland). During excavations,
        two morphotypes, one gracile and one robust, were identified in the field.
        Furthermore, two large-sized theropod ichnospecies (<jats:italic>Megalosauripus
        transjuranicus<\/jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Jurabrontes curtedulensis<\/jats:italic>)
        and an ornithopod-like morphotype (Morphotype II) have recently been described
        at these sites. <jats:bold>Methods.<\/jats:bold> The quality of preservation
        (preservation grade), the depth of the footprint, the shape variation and
        the footprint proportions (FL\/FW ratio and mesaxony) along the trackways
        have been analysed using 3D models and false-colour depth maps in order to
        determine the exact number of morphotypes present in the tracksites. <jats:bold>Results.
        <\/jats:bold>The study of the footprints (n = 93) collected during the excavations
        has made it possible to identify and characterize the two morphotypes distinguished
        in the field. The gracile morphotype is mainly characterized by a high footprint
        length\/width ratio, high mesaxony, low divarication angles and clear, sharp
        claw marks and phalangeal pads (2-3-4). By contrast, the robust morphotype
        is characterized by a lower footprint length\/width ratio, weaker mesaxony,
        slightly higher divarication angles and clear, sharp claw marks (when preserved),
        whereas the phalangeal pads are not clearly preserved although they might
        be present. <jats:bold>Discussion. <\/jats:bold>The analysis does not allow
        the two morphotypes to be associated within a morphological continuum. Thus,
        they cannot be a consequence of extramorphological variations on similar tracks
        produced by a similar\/single trackmaker. Comparison of the two morphotypes
        with the larger morphotypes described in the formation (<jats:italic>Megalosauripus
        transjuranicus<\/jats:italic>, <jats:italic>Jurabrontes curtedulensis <\/jats:italic>and
        Morphotype II) and the spatio-temporal relationships of the trackways suggest
        that the smaller morphotypes cannot reliably be considered small individuals
        of the larger morphotypes. The morphometric data of some specimens of the
        robust morphotype (even lower values for the length\/width ratio and mesaxony)
        suggest that more than one ichnotaxon might be represented within the robust
        morphotype. The features of the gracile morphotype (cf. <jats:italic>Kalohipus<\/jats:italic>)
        are typical of \u201cgrallatorid\u201d ichnotaxa with low mesaxony whereas
        those of the robust morphotype (cf. <jats:italic>Therangospodus<\/jats:italic>
        and ?<jats:italic>Therangospodus<\/jats:italic>) are reminiscent of <jats:italic>Therangospodus

        light on combining an analysis of variations in footprint morphology through
